# Description of the project
* The development of the network, the abnormality of the equipment, the increasingly obvious detection detection tools and tools are usually only for spelling, spelling and format detection detection detection detection network service repetitive work. The detection speed of working tools is slow, the detection ability is weak, and the general versatility is poor, etc. Unsupervised anomaly detection calculation method. Through statistical analysis, the calculation method can determine 7 detectable anomaly types, and supports anomaly location and anomaly modification scheme.
